    "\n",
    "OR-Tools is an open source software suite for optimization, tuned for tackling the world's toughest problems in vehicle routing, flows, integer and linear programming, and constraint programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "After modeling your problem in the programming language of your choice, you can use any of a half dozen solvers to solve it: commercial solvers such as Gurobi or CPLEX, or open-source solvers such as SCIP, GLPK, or Google's GLOP and award-winning CP-SAT.\n",

    "About Combinatorial Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "Combinatorial optimization seeks to find the best solution to a problem out of a very large set of possible solutions. Here are some examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "Vehicle routing: Find optimal routes for vehicle fleets that pick up and deliver packages given constraints (e.g., \"this truck can't hold more than 20,000 pounds\" or \"all deliveries must be made within a two-hour window”).\n",
    "\n",
    "Using OR-Tools with Python\n",
    "\n",
    "The following sections introduce you to using OR-Tools with Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "What is an optimization problem?\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of optimization is to find the best solution to a problem out of a large set of possible solutions. (Sometimes you'll be satisfied with finding any feasible solution; OR-Tools can do that as well.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a typical optimization problem. Suppose that a shipping company delivers packages to its customers using a fleet of trucks. Every day, the company must assign packages to trucks, and then a choose a route for each truck to deliver its packages. Each possible assignment of packages and routes has a cost, based on the total travel distance for the trucks, and possibly other factors as well. The problem is to choose the assignments of packages and routes that has the least cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like all optimization problems, this problem has the following elements:\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective—the quantity you want to optimize. In the example above, the objective is to minimize cost. To set up an optimization problem, you need to define a function that calculates the value of the objective for any possible solution. This is called the objective function. In the preceding example, the objective function would calculate the total cost of any assignment of packages and routes.\n",
    "\n",
    "An optimal solution is one for which the value of the objective function is the best. (\"Best\" can be either a maximum or a minimum.)\n",
    "The constraints—restrictions on the set of possible solutions, based on the specific requirements of the problem. For example, if the shipping company can't assign packages above a given weight to trucks, this would impose a constraint on the solutions. A feasible solution is one that satisfies all the given constraints for the problem, without necessarily being optimal.\n",
    "The first step in solving an optimization problem is identifying the objective and constraints.\n",

    "Routing\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most intriguing areas of operations research is routing, in which the goal is to find efficient paths for transporting items through a complex network. The network is usually represented by a graph like the one below. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each node represents a location, and a route is a path through a set of nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most real routing problems involve finding efficient routes for vehicles — cars, trains, airplanes, and so on — so they are often referred to as vehicle routing problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Routing problems can be divided into two main types — node-routing problems and arc-routing problems — depending on whether the goal is expressed in terms of visiting the nodes (locations) or the arcs (the edges connecting them). We'll give an example of each.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, here's an arc-routing problem that Google needs to solve daily. If you have seen the Google Maps Street View, you may have wondered how Google obtains street-level images at millions of addresses around the world. The answer is simple: a Google team continually drives the world's roads in a fleet of vehicles equipped with cameras that automatically take pictures of each address. Google's problem is to construct the shortest route for each vehicle that traverses every street in an assigned region. If you represent this problem by a graph, in which arcs represent streets, and nodes are street intersections, the arc-routing problem is to find the shortest path that traverses every arc in the graph. Google uses the same technology provided in OR-Tools to solve this problem every day.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of a node-routing problem is vehicle routing. Suppose that a company needs to deliver packages to various locations, using a fleet of vehicles. In the graph for this problem, nodes represent locations, and arcs represent routes between them. Each arc has a weight, corresponding to the cost of traveling that route. The problem: find a set of paths in the graph (corresponding to delivery routes for each vehicle) that includes every destination while minimizing the total cost. This differs from the arc-routing problem because the paths don't have to traverse every arc, just include every node."
